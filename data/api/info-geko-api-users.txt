Integration with B2B Platform:
    Below you will find files with our database ready for integration with online stores or other sales systems.
    The files are available in several different formats. XML files are more complete due to better technical capabilities, so we recommend using these files. The most popular formats are:
        - CSV - can be opened and edited in MS Excel or OpenOffice
        - XML - dedicated to IT specialists
        - EPP - intended for the Subiekt GT, Nexo software

    Before you start using the files, please read the most important suggestions::
        - Products should be imported and synchronized only according to EAN codes (the product name and code may change)
        - Do not freely distribute files on the Internet. We make files available only to selected clients - we do not want them to be available to everyone
        - You are not anonymous - every file download is recorded (including the computer's IP address)
        - The files are updated several times a day - it may happen that you sell a product that is still in stock in the file, but it is no longer in our warehouse
        - Files can be downloaded automatically - you need an API key for this - instructions on how to obtain it are available at the bottom of this page

    Advanced options - helpful for programmers:
        Integration links can be extended with various parameters.
        Dynamic parameters should be added to the end of the integration address.
        Dynamic parameters can be freely combined.


    Parameter - ID: 
        ?exfilters - excludes products with selected feature ID's
        ?filters - excludes products that do not have selected feature ID's (higher priority than exfilters)
        ?stream=true - Specifies that the contents of the file are to be returned directly in the response stream from the serwer. By default, the content is returned as a file, an attachment to the response from the serwer.


    Examples with parameters:
        /current-integration-link?exfilters=53,637,8843&filters=22,77225&stream=true
        /current-integration-link?stream=true
        /current-integration-link?filters=22,77225
