                            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>An âLâ type wrench</strong> is a reliable tool that will make your work easier. It has a <strong>450mm</strong> length, and works with sockets <strong>3/4"</strong>. Thanks to the long arm, you can get a higher torque and apply more force to nuts and bolts. You donât have to worry about the stability of the sockets, because the wrench has a <strong>ball grip</strong> that locks them. The wrench also works well in hard-to-reach places, where ordinary ratchets donât reach. To ensure your comfort and safety, the wrench has a satin finish and a knurled handle, which prevent slipping in case of dirt on the tool.</p> <h4>Product features:</h4> <ul> <li>Long arm increases torque and allows greater force transmission</li> <li><strong>Ball grip</strong> locking sockets during work</li> <li>Long arm enables work in hard-to-reach places</li> <li>Satin finish and knurled handle prevent slipping</li> <li>The wrench is durable and practical</li> <li>It has a length of <strong>450mm</strong> and works with sockets <strong>3/4"</strong>.</li> </ul>]]></description>

                            <long_desc xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[<p>The GEKO Wall Chaser with a laser guide is a device used for the precise and effective creation of grooves in concrete and other construction materials.</p><br/><h4>Power: 1700W</h4><br/><p>The concrete cutter is equipped with a 1700-watt motor, providing sufficient power for cutting through concrete. With a high motor rotational speed (up to 4,000 revolutions per minute), the tool is effective and efficient in the grooving process.</p><br/><h4>Blades</h4><br/><p>The device allows for the installation of two diamond blades with dimensions of 150x1.9x22.2 mm. Two blades working simultaneously enable faster and more efficient groove creation compared to tools with a single blade. This allows work on larger surfaces to be completed much faster. Moreover, two blades facilitate the creation of parallel grooves with a consistent width, which is crucial for precision-requiring projects. With two blades, the cutting process is distributed between them, reducing the load on a single blade and increasing the tool's durability.</p><br/><h4>Depth Adjustment: 10-40 mm</h4><br/><p>The ability to adjust the depth of grooving within the range of 10 to 40 mm. For many projects, it is essential to cut grooves at a specific depth. Depth adjustment allows the tool operator to precisely tailor the cutting depth, which is crucial for precision-demanding work. Depth adjustment helps avoid cutting too deep, which could damage structural elements of the concrete or other components beneath the surface, such as pipes or cables.</p><br/><h4>Groove Width: 14, 19, and 29 mm</h4><br/><p>The concrete cutter allows for creating grooves of various widths, providing flexibility to meet different project requirements. Adjusting the groove width to the project can reduce the amount of material required to fill the grooves, resulting in cost savings.</p><br/><h4>Laser Guide</h4><br/><p>The built-in laser indicator helps achieve high precision during groove cutting. The operator can follow the laser point, ensuring accurate and parallel grooving, particularly important in projects requiring precision, such as laying pipes or cables.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the laser indicator makes tool operation easier for the operator, especially for those with less experience in working with groovers. The laser indicator facilitates precise tool guidance. Reduced risk of errors during grooving is achieved thanks to the laser indicator, preventing unnecessary corrections and costly rework.</p><br/><h4>Vacuum Cleaner Connection</h4><br/><p>The vacuum cleaner connection allows for the attachment of an industrial vacuum or specialized dust extraction device directly to the groover. This enables effective and immediate removal of dust generated during work. Dust reduction is essential for the operator's health and safety, as concrete dust can be harmful to the respiratory system.</p><br/><p>Dust reduction through the vacuum cleaner means that the operator does not need to interrupt work to clean the work area, increasing work efficiency and allowing continuous operation.</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p><br/><p>SprawdÅº test narzÄdzia na naszym kanale w serwisie Youtube:</p><br/><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kqUKdPVAuVE" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>]]></long_desc>

Two blades working simultaneously enable faster and more efficient groove creation compared to tools with a single blade. This allows work on larger surfaces to be completed much faster. Moreover, two blades facilitate the creation of parallel grooves with a consistent width, which is crucial for precision-requiring projects. With two blades, the cutting process is distributed between them, reducing the load on a single blade and increasing the tool's durability.</p><br/><h4>Depth Adjustment: 10-40 mm</h4><br/><p>The ability to adjust the depth of grooving within the range of 10 to 40 mm. For many projects, it is essential to cut grooves at a specific depth. Depth adjustment allows the tool operator to precisely tailor the cutting depth, which is crucial for precision-demanding work. Depth adjustment helps avoid cutting too deep, which could damage structural elements of the concrete or other components beneath the surface, such as pipes or cables.</p><br/><h4>Groove Width: 14, 19, and 29 mm</h4><br/><p>The concrete cutter allows for creating grooves of various widths, providing flexibility to meet different project requirements. Adjusting the groove width to the project can reduce the amount of material required to fill the grooves, resulting in cost savings.</p><br/><h4>Laser Guide</h4><br/><p>The built-in laser indicator helps achieve high precision during groove cutting. The operator can follow the laser point, ensuring accurate and parallel grooving, particularly important in projects requiring precision, such as laying pipes or cables.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the laser indicator makes tool operation easier for the operator, especially for those with less experience in working with groovers.

                            <description><![CDATA[<p>The GEKO Wall Chaser with a laser guide is a device used for the precise and effective creation of grooves in concrete and other construction materials.</p><br/><h4>Power: 1700W</h4><br/><p>The concrete cutter is equipped with a 1700-watt motor, providing sufficient power for cutting through concrete. With a high motor rotational speed (up to 4,000 revolutions per minute), the tool is effective and efficient in the grooving process.</p><br/><h4>Blades</h4><br/><p>The device allows for the installation of two diamond blades with dimensions of 150x1.9x22.2 mm. Two blades working simultaneously enable faster and more efficient groove creation compared to tools with a single blade. This allows work on larger surfaces to be completed much faster. Moreover, two blades facilitate the creation of parallel grooves with a consistent width, which is crucial for precision-requiring projects.
