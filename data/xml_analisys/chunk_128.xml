Po uruchomieniu samochodu odstraszacz gryzoni znajduje się w trybie gotowości, gdy samochód zatrzyma się, dzięki inteligentnemu wykrywaniu funkcji zatrzymania pojazdu, po 120 sekundach urządzenie włączy się automatycznie w tryb pracy. Zielone światło zacznie migać i urządzenie będzie emitować ultradźwięki, aby odstraszyć gryzonie.</p>
<h4>Opis pracy produktu</h4>
<p>1. Z przodu panelu znajdują się trzy diody LED, po obu stronach dioda LED o mocnym świetle, a na środku lampka kontrolna pracy (dwukolorowa): czerwone światło miga, gdy produkt się zatrzymuje, a zielone światło, gdy działa;<br>
2. Gdy włącznik zasilania jest włączony, wskaźnik roboczy (czerwone światło) miga, fala ultradźwiękowa nie działa, a prąd czuwania wynosi 3 mA.<br>
Około 120 sekund po tym, jak samochód przestaje działać, produkt rozpoczyna pracę ultradźwiękową: robocze światło kontrolne miga z czerwonego na zielone światło i urządzenie wysyła falę ultradźwiękową (wysyłając automatyczną zmianę częstotliwość ultradźwiękowa: 20–60 kHz). Po uruchomieniu samochodu produkt przestaje działać (miga czerwona dioda).</p>
<p>Tryb pracy ultradźwięków, ma dwa tryby pracy:
<ul>
<li>A: Tryb odstraszania szczurów</li>
<li>B: Tryb silnego odstraszania gryzoni</li>
</ul>
Tryb odstraszania szczurów to automatyczna powolna zmiana częstotliwości ultradźwiękowej: automatycznie od 20 kHz do 60 kHz i od 60 kHz do 20 kHz; automatyczna zmiana cyklu. Całkowity czas pracy trybu wynosi około 120 sekund. Prąd roboczy wynosi 20-30 mA.<br>
Tryb silnego odstraszania gryzoni: Częstotliwość ultradźwiękowa produktu zmienia się gwałtownie w zakresie od 14–60 kHz do 60–14 kHz, a lampa miga, aby wzmocnić efekt szybkiego odstraszania gryzoni. Całkowity czas pracy w trybie silnego odstraszania gryzoni wynosi 130 sekund. Prąd roboczy wynosi 30-50 mA.</p>
</p>
<p>W zestawie kabel zasilający podłączany pod klemy akumulatora. Dodatkowo 4 opaski zaciskowe do montażu urządzenia.</p>

<p><strong>Wiertła pokryte warstwą TiN </strong>przeznaczone są w szczególności <strong>do obróbki materiałów trudnoskrawalnych.</strong> Zastosowanie powłoki TiN skutkuje <strong>wzrostem twardości wierteł</strong>, umożliwia przyspieszenie procesu skrawania oraz pozwala uzyskać lepszą jakość obrabianych elementów. <strong>Warstwa azotku tytanu dzięki redukcji siły tarcia zmniejsza zużycie ostra, a co za tym idzie wydłuża żywotność wiertła.</strong></p>
<h4>Specyfikacja techniczna:</h4>
<p>Rodzaj: <strong>frez stożkowy (pogłębiacz)</strong></p>
<p>Materiał: <strong>Stal HSS pokryta tytanem</strong></p>
<p>Średnica frezów [mm]: <strong>6,3 / 8,3 / 10,4 / 14,4 / 16,5 / 20,5</strong></p>
