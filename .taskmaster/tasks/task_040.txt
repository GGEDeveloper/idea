# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Advanced Multi-field Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 49
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a robust filtering system that allows users to apply multiple filters simultaneously across various product attributes. **Ensure filters related to restricted information (e.g., price range, stock) behave correctly for unauthenticated users (e.g., disabled or not shown).**
# Details:
Combines filters logically (AND/OR), operating on data sourced from PostgreSQL.

# Test Strategy:
Verify complex filter combinations yield correct results. **Test filter behavior for unauthenticated users regarding restricted data.**

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Filter UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop reusable React components for various filter types (e.g., text search, dropdowns, multi-select, date ranges, sliders) within the Next.js frontend. Ensure internationalization (i18n) support, responsiveness, and accessibility. Define component props, state management for individual filters, and integrate with the overall UI framework.
### Details:
Define component props, state management for individual filters, styling (e.g., Tailwind CSS), accessibility considerations (ARIA attributes), i18n integration. Focus on user experience and intuitive filter selection.

## 2. Develop Backend Filter Logic and API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the server-side logic for combining multiple filter criteria using AND/OR operators. Design and expose robust API endpoints (via Next.js API routes) that accept filter parameters and query the PostgreSQL (Neo) database. Integrate with API Geko for data retrieval and ensure efficient database queries.
### Details:
Define API request/response schemas, implement SQL query generation based on filter combinations, handle edge cases, and ensure efficient database queries. Consider using a query builder for dynamic query construction. Implement comprehensive logging for API requests and database interactions.

## 3. Integrate Frontend with Filter API and Display Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1, 40.2
### Description: Connect the frontend filter UI components to the backend filter API endpoints. Implement client-side state management (e.g., React Context, Zustand) to manage active filters and trigger data fetches. Display filtered results efficiently, including pagination, loading states, and error handling. Ensure smooth user experience.
### Details:
Implement debouncing for search inputs, error handling for API calls, skeleton loaders/spinners, pagination logic, and efficient rendering of large datasets. Ensure data consistency between frontend and backend. Implement logging for client-side filter application and data fetching.

## 4. Implement Role-Based Filter Permissions and Data Access [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2, 40.3
### Description: Integrate Auth.js/Clerk to enforce authentication and authorization for filter options and data visibility. Implement logic to dynamically enable/disable filter options or restrict data based on user roles and permissions. Ensure sensitive data is not exposed and compliance requirements are met.
### Details:
Define roles and permissions within the authentication system. Modify backend queries to include authorization checks based on user context. Update frontend UI to reflect available filters and data based on user permissions. Implement secure token handling and comprehensive logging of access attempts.

## 5. Optimize Filter Performance and Implement Automated Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1, 40.2, 40.3, 40.4
### Description: Profile and optimize the performance of the entire filtering system, focusing on database queries, API response times, and frontend rendering. Implement comprehensive automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) for all filter functionalities, including edge cases, security, and internationalization. Prepare for cloud-native deployment on Vercel.
### Details:
Database indexing, query optimization, caching strategies (e.g., Redis, Vercel Edge Cache), frontend memoization, and code splitting. Use Jest/React Testing Library for unit/integration tests, and Playwright/Cypress for E2E tests. Set up structured logging (e.g., Pino) for performance metrics, errors, and user interactions. Ensure deployability on Vercel.
