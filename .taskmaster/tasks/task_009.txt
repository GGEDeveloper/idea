# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Product Listing Pagination
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add pagination controls to the Product Listing Page to navigate through multiple pages of products.
# Details:
Supports large product catalogs.

# Test Strategy:
Verify pagination links work and display correct product sets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Pagination UI Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a reusable Next.js/React UI component for pagination controls (e.g., previous, next, page numbers, first, last). The component must be responsive, accessible, and integrate seamlessly with internationalization (i18n) for labels. It should manage URL state via Next.js router and be ready for deployment on Vercel.
### Details:
Design and implement the React component for pagination controls using Next.js. Integrate with Next.js router to update 'page' query parameters in the URL. Apply application-wide styling and ensure responsiveness across devices. Implement internationalization (i18n) for all visible text elements (e.g., 'Previous', 'Next', 'Page'). Ensure full accessibility (WCAG compliance, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation). Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for the UI component to ensure functionality and robustness. Consider UI state management for loading/error states.

## 2. Develop Pagination Logic & Product Set Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the server-side and client-side logic for handling product data pagination. This includes defining Next.js API routes to fetch and process paginated product data from the external Geko API, managing product sets based on 'page' and 'limit' parameters, and integrating with PostgreSQL (Neo) if complex data manipulation or caching is required. Ensure robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and performance optimization for cloud-native deployment on Vercel.
### Details:
Define and implement Next.js API routes (e.g., '/api/products?page={page}&limit={limit}') to serve paginated product data. Implement server-side logic to make requests to the Geko API, handling authentication if required. Process and transform raw data received from the Geko API to fit the application's product data model. Implement pagination logic (offset/limit or cursor-based) to correctly slice data from Geko API responses or PostgreSQL (Neo) if used as an intermediary. Integrate with PostgreSQL (Neo) for any necessary data persistence, complex filtering, or caching of product sets beyond direct Geko API capabilities. Implement comprehensive error handling for Geko API calls and data processing, including retry mechanisms and fallback strategies. Integrate logging (e.g., using a dedicated logging library) for all critical operations, errors, and performance metrics. Develop unit and integration tests for the pagination logic, API routes, and data processing. Optimize data fetching and processing for performance, considering Vercel's serverless environment.
