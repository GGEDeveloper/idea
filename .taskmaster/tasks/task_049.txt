# Task ID: 49
# Title: Implement Permission Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24, 32, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 34, 35, 39, 40
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a granular permission management system to control access to different features and data based on user roles (admin, client, visitor). **This system must enforce that only authenticated users can view prices, stock, and restricted commercial information, and only admins can create customer accounts and manage order statuses.**
# Details:
Integrates with authentication and authorization, with permissions data stored in PostgreSQL. **Define clear permissions for 'guest', 'authenticated customer', and 'admin' roles regarding data visibility (prices, stock, commercial info) and actions (account creation, order status updates).**

# Test Strategy:
Verify users can only access features permitted by their role. **Extensively test data visibility (prices, stock) for guests vs. authenticated users. Test admin-only actions like account creation and order status updates.**

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Role Definition Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the backend services, API endpoints, and database schema for defining and managing user roles (e.g., Administrator, Editor, Viewer). This includes CRUD operations for roles and their attributes, ensuring a flexible and extensible structure for future role types.
### Details:
Focus on cloud-native design principles for scalability and resilience. Consider UI/UX implications for an intuitive role management interface. Ensure proper data modeling for role hierarchies if applicable.

## 2. Establish Permission Specification Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.1
### Description: Design and implement a robust framework for specifying granular permissions associated with roles. This involves defining permission types (e.g., 'read', 'write', 'delete', 'execute') and associating them with specific resources, functionalities, or data entities. The framework should allow for fine-grained control.
### Details:
The framework must be extensible to accommodate new permission types and resources without major refactoring. Ensure internationalization support for permission descriptions and labels. Implement mechanisms for traceability of permission assignments.

## 3. Implement Core Access Control Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.1, 49.2
### Description: Develop the central access control engine responsible for evaluating user permissions against requested actions and resources. This engine will use the defined roles and permissions to determine if a user is authorized to perform a specific operation, acting as the core decision point for all authorization requests.
### Details:
Prioritize performance, security, and low latency for authorization decisions. Implement comprehensive logging for all access attempts (successes and failures) to ensure auditability and traceability. Design for high availability and fault tolerance in a cloud-native environment.

## 4. Develop Data Visibility and Scoping Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.3
### Description: Implement mechanisms to enforce data visibility rules based on user roles and permissions. This includes developing row-level security, column-level security, and data scoping logic (e.g., users only seeing data from their own organization or specific projects).
### Details:
Address potential performance impacts of complex data filtering and ensure efficient query generation. Design UI/UX elements to clearly reflect data visibility limitations to the user. Ensure these rules are applied consistently across all data access layers.

## 5. Integrate Action Authorization Across Application Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.3, 49.4
### Description: Integrate the core access control engine into various application modules, API endpoints, and UI components to authorize specific user actions (e.g., creating a report, modifying a user profile, accessing a specific API route). This involves identifying all critical actions and applying authorization checks.
### Details:
Ensure consistent application of authorization rules across the entire system, including both backend APIs and frontend UI elements. Provide clear error messages for unauthorized access. Implement robust error handling and logging for authorization failures.

## 6. Integrate Permission System with Authentication Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.1, 49.3, 49.5
### Description: Connect the newly developed permission system with the existing authentication module to retrieve user identities and their assigned roles upon successful login. This ensures that permissions are correctly loaded and applied for authenticated users throughout their session.
### Details:
Define the interface for role assignment and retrieval from the authentication provider (e.g., OAuth2, OpenID Connect). Consider implications for single sign-on (SSO) and session management. Ensure secure transmission of role and permission data.

## 7. Conduct Comprehensive Permission System Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.1, 49.2, 49.3, 49.4, 49.5, 49.6
### Description: Perform extensive testing of the entire permission system, including unit tests for individual components, integration tests for end-to-end flows, security tests (e.g., penetration testing, authorization bypass attempts), and performance tests under various load conditions. Validate all functional and non-functional requirements.
### Details:
Develop detailed test cases covering all roles, permissions, edge cases, and unauthorized access scenarios. Ensure traceability of test results to original requirements. Include UI/UX testing for permission-related elements and internationalization validation for all displayed texts. Implement automated regression tests.
