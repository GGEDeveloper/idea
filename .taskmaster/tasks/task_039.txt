# Task ID: 39
# Title: Implement Instant Search with Autocomplete
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 49
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a site-wide search functionality with instant results and autocomplete suggestions as the user types. **Ensure search results respect user authentication status, hiding prices, stock, and restricted commercial information for unauthenticated users.**
# Details:
Optimized for speed and relevance, leveraging PostgreSQL for search indexing and data retrieval.

# Test Strategy:
Verify search results appear instantly and autocomplete suggestions are accurate. **Test search results visibility for restricted data for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.**

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Search UI with Autocomplete [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the frontend search bar component using Next.js/React, incorporating real-time autocomplete suggestions. This includes UI/UX design, input handling, and initial integration points for backend search and internationalization.
### Details:
Utilize Next.js/React for the frontend. Implement autocomplete functionality. Ensure internationalization support. Prepare for integration with backend search API. Consider accessibility standards.

## 2. Develop Search Algorithm and Backend API [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core search algorithm on the backend, including data indexing and retrieval logic. Expose a robust API endpoint for the frontend to query. Integrate with PostgreSQL (Neo) for data storage and potentially Geko API for data sourcing.
### Details:
Design and implement search logic using PostgreSQL (Neo). Create RESTful or GraphQL API endpoints for search queries. Integrate with Geko API for data if required. Implement comprehensive logging for search queries and backend performance.

## 3. Implement Search Result Display with Authentication-based Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.1, 39.2
### Description: Develop the frontend component responsible for displaying search results. This includes fetching results from the backend, rendering them, and applying authentication-based filtering using Auth.js/Clerk to ensure users only see permitted content.
### Details:
Use Next.js/React for result display. Integrate with Auth.js/Clerk for user authentication and authorization. Implement logic to filter search results based on user permissions. Handle pagination, loading states, and error display. Ensure internationalization of result display.

## 4. Optimize Search Performance and Implement Automated Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.1, 39.2, 39.3
### Description: Conduct performance profiling and optimization for both frontend (UI responsiveness, rendering) and backend (query speed, indexing). Implement comprehensive automated tests for all search functionality, including UI, backend logic, and authentication filtering.
### Details:
Perform database query optimization for PostgreSQL (Neo). Implement caching strategies. Optimize Next.js/React component rendering. Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for search UI, backend API, and Auth.js/Clerk integration. Ensure comprehensive logging for performance monitoring and debugging. Prepare for cloud-native deployment on Vercel.
