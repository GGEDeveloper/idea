# Task ID: 44
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize website performance through caching mechanisms, lazy loading of images/components, and Content Delivery Network (CDN) integration.
# Details:
Reduce page load times through caching mechanisms (compatible with PostgreSQL), lazy loading of images/components, and Content Delivery Network (CDN) integration.

# Test Strategy:
Monitor page load times and network requests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Data and API Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data and API responses to reduce database load and improve response times.
### Details:
Focus on server-side caching for Next.js API routes (e.g., `revalidate` option, `fetch` caching), client-side caching (e.g., `SWR` or `React Query` for data fetching), and potentially PostgreSQL (Neo) for persistent data caching if applicable beyond `fetch` caching. Consider caching API Geko responses.

## 2. Implement Lazy Loading for Frontend Assets [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize frontend performance by implementing lazy loading for images, components, and other non-critical assets.
### Details:
Utilize Next.js built-in image optimization (`next/image`) and dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) for components. Prioritize large images and components below the fold for the Next.js/React frontend.

## 3. Integrate CDN for Static Asset Delivery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and integrate a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets (images, CSS, JS) globally, reducing latency and improving load times.
### Details:
Leverage Vercel's built-in CDN capabilities for Next.js deployments. Ensure proper asset paths and cache headers are configured for optimal delivery.

## 4. Establish Performance Monitoring and Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.1, 44.2, 44.3
### Description: Set up tools and processes for continuous performance monitoring, load testing, and identifying bottlenecks after optimizations are implemented.
### Details:
Integrate performance monitoring tools (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Lighthouse CI, Web Vitals reporting). Conduct automated load testing for API endpoints and critical user flows. Establish benchmarks and define performance KPIs for the Next.js application.

## 5. Implement Application Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement caching strategies (e.g., in-memory, distributed cache like Redis) for frequently accessed data and computed results to reduce database load and improve response times. This includes identifying cacheable data, choosing caching technology, implementing cache invalidation strategies, and integrating with existing data access layers.
### Details:
Identify cacheable data types and access patterns. Select appropriate caching technology (e.g., Redis, Memcached, in-memory). Implement cache-aside or write-through patterns. Develop robust cache invalidation mechanisms. Integrate caching into data access layers and API endpoints. Ensure cache consistency and handle race conditions.

## 6. Implement Lazy Loading for Resources [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure lazy loading for images, videos, and other non-critical assets to improve initial page load times by deferring their loading until they are needed or visible in the viewport. This involves identifying assets for lazy loading, integrating a lazy loading library/mechanism, and testing its impact on core web vitals.
### Details:
Identify all non-critical visual assets (images, videos, iframes) suitable for lazy loading. Utilize native browser lazy loading (`loading='lazy'`) where applicable. For unsupported cases or complex scenarios, implement Intersection Observer API or a lightweight lazy loading library. Test the impact on Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Ensure graceful degradation for older browsers.

## 7. Integrate Content Delivery Network (CDN) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and integrate a CDN service (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to serve static assets (images, CSS, JS, fonts) from edge locations closer to users, reducing latency and improving asset delivery speed. This includes selecting a CDN provider, configuring distribution, and updating asset URLs.
### Details:
Evaluate and select a suitable CDN provider based on project requirements and budget. Configure CDN distribution for static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts). Update application asset URLs to point to the CDN. Implement cache control headers for optimal CDN caching. Test CDN performance, cache hit ratios, and global asset delivery speed.

## 8. Establish Performance Monitoring and Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.5, 44.6, 44.7
### Description: Set up tools and processes for continuous performance monitoring (e.g., APM, RUM) and conduct regular performance testing (load testing, stress testing) to identify bottlenecks and ensure sustained performance after optimizations. This involves choosing monitoring tools, defining KPIs, setting up alerts, and conducting baseline and post-optimization tests.
### Details:
Select and integrate Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) and Real User Monitoring (RUM) solutions. Define key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response times, error rates, throughput, and core web vitals. Configure alerts for performance degradation. Develop and execute load, stress, and soak tests using tools like JMeter or k6. Analyze test results and identify performance bottlenecks. Establish a continuous performance testing pipeline.
