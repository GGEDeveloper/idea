# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Personal Data and Address Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable customers to view, edit, and manage their personal information and shipping/billing addresses within their account.
# Details:
Secure update functionality, with data stored in PostgreSQL.

# Test Strategy:
Verify users can update their data and addresses correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Secure Personal Data Display [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the frontend components and backend API integration to securely fetch and display a user's personal data.
### Details:
Utilize Next.js/React for the user interface. Integrate with Auth.js/Clerk for user authentication and authorization context. Implement API calls to a backend endpoint (connected to PostgreSQL via API Geko) to retrieve user data. Ensure data is displayed in a read-only format initially. Include internationalization support, basic error handling, and comprehensive logging for data retrieval events.

## 2. Develop Personal Data Edit Interface and Client-Side Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Create interactive forms and input fields within the frontend to allow users to modify their personal information, incorporating client-side validation.
### Details:
Build React forms for editable personal data fields (e.g., name, email, address). Implement real-time client-side validation (e.g., email format, required fields). Provide clear user feedback for validation errors. Ensure accessibility standards are met. Prepare data for submission to a backend API.

## 3. Implement Secure Personal Data Update API, Server-Side Validation, and Database Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Develop the secure backend API endpoint and logic for processing, validating, and persisting updated personal data to the database.
### Details:
Create a secure API endpoint (e.g., Next.js API route) that receives updated personal data. Implement robust server-side validation, sanitization, and authorization checks using Auth.js/Clerk. Securely update the PostgreSQL database. Ensure transactionality for data integrity. Implement comprehensive logging for all update attempts (success/failure) and integrate automated tests for API functionality, security, and data integrity. Prepare for cloud-native deployment on Vercel.
