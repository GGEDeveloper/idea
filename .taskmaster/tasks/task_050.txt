# Task ID: 50
# Title: Implement Automated Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and integrate automated testing frameworks for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (e2e) tests.
# Details:
Ensures code quality and prevents regressions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify test suites run successfully and cover critical functionalities.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Unit Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the necessary tools and configurations for writing and running unit tests for individual code components.
### Details:
Select a suitable unit testing framework (e.g., Jest, Pytest, JUnit), configure test runners, define a standard test file structure, and create initial example unit tests for core functionalities to validate the setup. Ensure compatibility with cloud-native execution environments.

## 2. Implement Integration Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.1
### Description: Establish the environment and tools for testing interactions between different modules, services, or external dependencies.
### Details:
Choose an integration testing framework, configure mock services or a dedicated test database, define strategies for test data management, and write initial integration tests covering key component interactions and API endpoints. Focus on ensuring traceability of integrated components.

## 3. Implement End-to-End Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.1, 50.2
### Description: Set up the infrastructure and tools for simulating complete user journeys and application flows from start to finish.
### Details:
Select an end-to-end testing framework (e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium), configure browser automation, define comprehensive test scenarios for critical user paths, and create initial E2E tests. Ensure the setup supports testing UI/UX, authentication, and permissions across the full stack.

## 4. Integrate Testing into CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.1, 50.2, 50.3
### Description: Automate the execution of all defined test suites (unit, integration, E2E) within the continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline.
### Details:
Configure the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to automatically trigger test runs on code commits, pull requests, and deployments. Ensure proper reporting of test results, including pass/fail status and execution logs, for traceability and rapid feedback.

## 5. Implement Test Coverage Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 50.1, 50.2, 50.3
### Description: Set up tools and configurations to measure and report the code coverage achieved by the implemented test suites.
### Details:
Integrate a code coverage tool (e.g., Istanbul, JaCoCo, Coverage.py) with the unit, integration, and E2E testing frameworks. Configure coverage thresholds, generate detailed coverage reports, and ensure these reports are accessible (e.g., published as CI/CD artifacts or to a dedicated service) for monitoring code quality and identifying untested areas.
