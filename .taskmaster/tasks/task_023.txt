# Task ID: 23
# Title: Develop Customer Area Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 34
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure user login for the Customer Area. User registration and password recovery are handled manually by the admin upon user request (no self-service registration or password reset).
# Details:
Authentication must be secure and compliant. No 2FA or public password reset. Admin is solely responsible for creating accounts and resetting passwords upon user contact. Remove all self-registration and password reset flows from UI and backend. Maintain logging/audit trail for all authentication events. Internationalization (PT/EN) and friendly fallback required.

# Test Strategy:
Verify users can log in successfully. Confirm that there is no self-registration or password reset flow available to users. Test that only admins can create or reset accounts. Check that all authentication events are logged and all messages are correctly internationalized.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Secure Login Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop backend logic for secure user login using Auth.js/Clerk and PostgreSQL. Ensure password hashing and session management.
### Details:
No 2FA, no self-registration, no public password reset endpoints. Only login functionality exposed to users.

## 2. Remove/Disable Self-Registration and Password Reset Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Ensure there are no UI elements, API endpoints, or backend logic for user self-registration or password reset. All such flows must be fully disabled or removed.
### Details:
Test direct API calls as well as UI. Document that password resets are only performed by admin upon user contact.

## 3. Admin-Only Account Creation and Password Reset [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Document and implement the process for admins to manually create user accounts and reset passwords upon request.
### Details:
Admins use an internal/admin interface or CLI to manage accounts. All actions are logged (who, when, what).

## 4. Internationalization (PT/EN) for Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Ensure all authentication-related UI and error messages are available in Portuguese and English, with proper fallback.
### Details:
Cobre mensagens de login, erro, bloqueio, instruções de contato para recuperação.

### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.4
### Description: Display friendly, internationalized messages for authentication errors and for any unavailable flows (e.g., password reset).
### Details:
Nunca exibir mensagens técnicas ao usuário final. Orientar a entrar em contato com o admin para suporte.

## 7. Write Unit, Integration, and E2E Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5, 23.6
### Description: Test login, absence of self-registration and password reset, admin-only flows, logging, i18n, and fallback handling.
### Details:
Cobrir tentativas válidas e inválidas, edge cases, e checar logs/audit trail.

## 8. Document Authentication Workflow and Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5, 23.6, 23.7
### Description: Document the authentication process, admin-only flows, and compliance/business rules for account management.
### Details:


## 4. User Authentication API Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Implement API endpoints for user login, validating credentials against stored hashes and generating secure authentication tokens (e.g., JWT).
### Details:
Implement login endpoint with credential validation, brute-force protection, and secure token generation. Ensure secure communication (HTTPS). Execution time tracking (timestamp) is required for this subtask.

## 5. Secure Session & Token Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.4
### Description: Develop mechanisms for secure session management, including token issuance, validation, refresh, and revocation (e.g., JWT blacklisting, refresh token rotation).
### Details:
Implement token refresh, revocation mechanisms, and secure storage for tokens (e.g., HttpOnly cookies). Define session expiry policies. Execution time tracking (timestamp) is required for this subtask.

## 6. Password Recovery API & Email Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Implement API for password recovery, including secure token generation, email delivery of recovery links, and password reset functionality.
### Details:
Implement secure password reset flow with single-use tokens, expiry, and email integration. Prevent enumeration attacks. Execution time tracking (timestamp) is required for this subtask.

## 7. User Login & Password Recovery UI Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.4, 23.6
### Description: Develop and integrate user-facing UI components for login and password recovery, ensuring secure communication with respective APIs.
### Details:
Develop user-facing UI for login and password recovery. Ensure secure form submission, client-side validation, and clear user feedback. Execution time tracking (timestamp) is required for this subtask.

## 8. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3, 23.5
### Description: Implement RBAC to enforce permissions, ensuring unauthenticated users cannot access sensitive data and admin roles are properly enforced.
### Details:
Define roles (e.g., admin, regular user). Implement authorization checks at API and UI levels. Ensure least privilege principle. Execution time tracking (timestamp) is required for this subtask.

## 9. Comprehensive Logging, Monitoring & Fallback [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2, 23.4, 23.6
### Description: Implement detailed logging for all authentication events (login attempts, password resets, admin actions), integrate monitoring, and define robust error handling/fallback strategies.
### Details:
Implement centralized logging for security events (failed logins, admin actions). Set up monitoring alerts. Define graceful degradation and error recovery strategies. Execution time tracking (timestamp) is required for this subtask.

## 10. Security Testing, Integration Testing & Documentation [pending]
