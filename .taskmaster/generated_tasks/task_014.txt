# Task ID: 14
# Title: Handle Product Variations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 49
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement functionality to select and display different product variations (e.g., color, size) on the Product Detail Page, updating price and stock accordingly. **Ensure price and stock updates for variations are only visible to authenticated users.**
# Details:
Requires backend support for variations, with variation data managed in PostgreSQL.

# Test Strategy:
Verify variation selection updates product details correctly. **Test price/stock updates for variations for unauthenticated users.**

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Product Variation Data Model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema for products, variation attributes (e.g., color, size), attribute values, and product-variation (SKU) combinations.
### Details:
Includes defining tables for products, attributes, attribute values, and a linking table for product-variation combinations (SKUs), ensuring scalability and flexibility for future attributes. Consider unique constraints and indexing for efficient data retrieval.

## 2. Develop Backend API for Variation Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on product variations, attributes, and their values.
### Details:
Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting product variations, attributes, and their associated values. Include validation, error handling, and basic logging for administrative actions.

## 3. Implement Frontend Variation Selection UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop reusable UI components (e.g., dropdowns, swatches, radio buttons) for selecting product variation attributes.
### Details:
Focus on creating accessible and responsive UI components that dynamically render based on the available variation attributes for a given product. Components should be modular and reusable.

## 4. Develop Client-Side Logic for Variation Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Implement JavaScript logic to handle user interactions with variation selectors and manage the selected variation state.
### Details:
This involves capturing user selections, updating the internal state of the chosen variation, and triggering events that will be used for dynamic price/stock updates and conditional visibility.

## 5. Develop Backend API for Price & Stock Retrieval [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create a dedicated API endpoint to fetch the price, stock quantity, and availability status for a given set of selected variation attributes.
### Details:
Ensure the API endpoint is optimized for quick responses, efficiently querying the database to return the correct SKU's price, stock level, and availability based on the provided product ID and selected variation attributes.

## 6. Implement Real-time Price & Stock Update Logic (Frontend) [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4, 14.5
### Description: Develop client-side logic to dynamically update the displayed price, stock status, and availability based on the user's selected variation.
### Details:
Implement JavaScript to call the backend price/stock API (Subtask 5) whenever a variation selection changes, and then update the product's displayed price, stock message, and the state of the add-to-cart button on the product page.

## 7. Implement Conditional Variation Visibility Logic (Frontend) [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Develop client-side logic to dynamically enable/disable or show/hide specific variation options based on prior selections or availability.
### Details:
This logic ensures that only valid and available variation combinations are presented to the user (e.g., if 'Size: Small' is selected, 'Color: Red' might be unavailable or disabled if that specific combination is out of stock).

## 8. Integrate Frontend with Backend Variation APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7
### Description: Connect the frontend UI and client-side logic with the backend APIs for seamless data flow and dynamic updates.
### Details:
Establish the communication between the frontend components and the backend APIs, ensuring proper data exchange for variation selection, price/stock updates, and conditional visibility. Implement robust error handling for API calls.

## 9. Develop Admin Panel for Product Variation Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Build a user interface within the admin panel for store administrators to define, manage, and link variations to products.
### Details:
This panel will allow administrators to define product attributes, create variation combinations, assign unique prices, stock levels, and manage images for each SKU. Implement role-based access control (permissions) for this panel.

## 10. Implement Comprehensive Testing & Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.8, 14.9
### Description: Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all variation functionality, and create developer/user documentation.
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive test suite covering both frontend and backend aspects of product variations. Create detailed developer documentation for API usage and frontend component integration, and user documentation for the admin panel. Ensure logging is in place for critical operations to facilitate debugging and auditing.
