# Task ID: 48
# Title: Implement Secure Image and Asset Upload
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 36
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a secure system for uploading and managing images and other assets, primarily for product and content management.
# Details:
Includes validation, resizing, and secure storage, with asset metadata managed in PostgreSQL.

# Test Strategy:
Verify assets can be uploaded securely and are accessible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Asset Upload User Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the frontend user interface for uploading assets, including drag-and-drop functionality, progress indicators, and error messaging. Focus on UI/UX, responsiveness, and internationalization.
### Details:
Design and implement responsive UI components for file selection and drag-and-drop. Display real-time upload progress and status. Provide clear feedback for successful uploads, validation errors, and system errors. Implement client-side validation for basic file types and sizes. Ensure UI/UX best practices are followed (e.g., accessibility, clear calls to action). Integrate with backend APIs for file upload. Implement internationalization (i18n) for all UI texts. Add client-side logging for UI interactions and errors. Develop unit and integration tests for UI components.

## 2. Develop Asset Validation and Security Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement robust backend validation for uploaded assets and establish comprehensive security measures, including authentication, authorization, and vulnerability prevention, ensuring cloud-native principles.
### Details:
Implement server-side validation for file type, size, and content (e.g., MIME type checking, magic number validation). Integrate with existing authentication and authorization systems to control upload access. Implement permission checks based on user roles for asset uploads. Sanitize file names and metadata to prevent path traversal and injection attacks. Scan uploaded files for malicious content (e.g., virus scanning integration). Implement rate limiting and brute-force protection for upload endpoints. Ensure secure storage of uploaded assets (e.g., S3, secure file system). Implement robust error handling and logging for all validation and security events. Develop API endpoints for asset upload. Implement traceability for upload requests (e.g., request IDs, user context). Develop unit, integration, and security tests for backend logic. Ensure cloud-native principles (statelessness, scalability).

## 3. Implement Image Processing and Optimization Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 48.2
### Description: Develop a dedicated backend service for processing uploaded images, including resizing, format conversion, and optimization, ensuring efficient storage and delivery after validation.
### Details:
Develop a microservice or module for image manipulation (resizing to various dimensions, cropping, watermarking). Implement image optimization techniques (e.g., compression, metadata stripping, WebP conversion). Integrate with the asset storage solution for fetching and storing processed images. Handle various image formats and ensure consistent output. Implement asynchronous processing for image transformations to avoid blocking the main upload flow. Ensure idempotency for image processing operations. Implement robust error handling and logging for image processing failures. Develop unit and integration tests for image processing logic. Ensure cloud-native principles (e.g., serverless functions for processing, event-driven architecture). Implement traceability for image processing tasks.
