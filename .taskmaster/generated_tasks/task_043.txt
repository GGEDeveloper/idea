# Task ID: 43
# Title: Implement SEO Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Apply SEO best practices including Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG), dynamic metadata, sitemap generation, and robots.txt configuration.
# Details:
Improve search engine visibility.

# Test Strategy:
Verify meta tags are correct and sitemap/robots.txt are accessible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement SSR/SSG for SEO [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Next.js pages to leverage Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) to ensure all critical content is pre-rendered and fully crawlable by search engines, improving initial page load and SEO performance.
### Details:
Focus on `getServerSideProps` for dynamic content and `getStaticProps` for static or frequently accessed content. Ensure proper data fetching from API Geko. Adapt for Vercel deployment.

## 2. Develop Dynamic Metadata Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Implement a robust system for dynamically generating unique and relevant meta titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, and other SEO metadata for each page based on its content, data retrieved from API Geko, and internationalization settings.
### Details:
Utilize Next.js `Head` component. Ensure metadata is generated based on route parameters and fetched data. Support multiple languages for metadata. Integrate with Auth.js/Clerk if metadata depends on user state.

## 3. Automate Sitemap Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.1, 43.2
### Description: Create an automated process to generate and keep updated an XML sitemap (`sitemap.xml`) that accurately lists all crawlable pages, including dynamically generated routes and internationalized versions, making it accessible for search engines.
### Details:
Develop a script or use a library to generate the sitemap. Ensure it includes all relevant URLs, handles dynamic routes from API Geko, and supports internationalization. Automate its regeneration upon content updates. Host on Vercel.

## 4. Configure Robots.txt for Crawler Control [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.3
### Description: Create and configure the `robots.txt` file to guide search engine crawlers, specifying which parts of the site should or should not be indexed, and explicitly pointing to the generated XML sitemap.
### Details:
Place `robots.txt` in the public directory. Include `User-agent` directives for common bots. Add the `Sitemap` directive pointing to the generated sitemap. Ensure it aligns with SEO strategy and privacy requirements.

## 5. Implement SSR/SSG for SEO Core [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the application to leverage Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) to ensure content is fully rendered and crawlable by search engines before being delivered to the client. This is foundational for SEO.
### Details:
Set up the rendering framework (e.g., Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby) to pre-render pages. Ensure all critical content is available in the initial HTML response. Address potential hydration issues that might affect SEO. Verify content accessibility for crawlers.

## 6. Develop Dynamic Metadata Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.5
### Description: Implement a system to dynamically generate and inject SEO-relevant metadata (e.g., title, description, og:title, og:description, og:image, twitter:card) based on page content or data for improved search engine visibility and social sharing.
### Details:
Create reusable components or functions to generate meta tags. Integrate with content management systems or data sources to fetch relevant information for each page. Handle default metadata for pages without specific content. Ensure proper escaping and encoding.

## 7. Implement Automated Sitemap Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.5
### Description: Develop a mechanism to automatically generate and maintain an XML sitemap (sitemap.xml) that lists all crawlable URLs on the website, including last modification dates and priority, to help search engines discover content.
### Details:
Integrate a sitemap generation library or custom script. Ensure the sitemap is updated automatically when new content is added or existing content is modified. Support sitemap index files for large sites. Validate sitemap structure and accessibility.

## 8. Configure Robots.txt for Crawler Directives [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.7
### Description: Create and configure the robots.txt file to guide search engine crawlers on which parts of the site they should or should not access, and to specify the location of the sitemap for efficient crawling.
### Details:
Define User-agent directives. Specify Disallow rules for private or irrelevant sections (e.g., admin panels, search results pages). Add Allow rules for specific paths within disallowed sections if necessary. Include the Sitemap directive pointing to the generated sitemap. Test robots.txt rules.
