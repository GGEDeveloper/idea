# Task ID: 47
# Title: Implement API Integration and Local Cache
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the backend API integration layer for data exchange with Geko API and implement local caching strategies using PostgreSQL to reduce API calls and improve performance.
# Details:
Secure API communication. Implement initial price adjustment logic (margins, transport, etc.) for Geko API data before it's passed to the frontend. Ensure raw Geko prices are never exposed and are always processed through the adjustment logic. Leverage PostgreSQL for efficient data caching and persistence of processed Geko API data, aligning with cloud-native deployment on Vercel/Cloud.

# Test Strategy:
Verify data is fetched correctly from Geko API and cached effectively in PostgreSQL. Crucially, verify price adjustment logic is applied correctly to all incoming product price data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core API Client [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational API client for external service communication, handling connection management and basic request/response.
### Details:
Focus on HTTP client setup, request/response serialization (JSON/XML), timeout configurations, and initial authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth token acquisition).

## 2. Develop Data Transformation Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1
### Description: Create a robust layer responsible for mapping external API data formats to internal system models and vice-versa.
### Details:
Define clear data schemas for input/output, implement data validation, type conversions, and handle potential data discrepancies or missing fields from the external API.

## 3. Implement Price Adjustment Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.2
### Description: Develop the core business logic for dynamically adjusting prices based on external API data, internal rules, and market conditions.
### Details:
Incorporate rules for discounts, surcharges, currency conversion, real-time market adjustments, and ensure traceability of price changes. Consider edge cases for pricing calculations.

## 4. Implement Robust Error Handling and Resilience [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1
### Description: Design and implement comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, and circuit breakers for all API calls.
### Details:
Define custom error types, implement exponential backoff for retries, configure circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures, and ensure detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.

## 5. Design and Implement Caching Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1, 47.2
### Description: Develop a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed API responses, improving performance and reducing external API load.
### Details:
Choose appropriate caching technology (e.g., Redis, in-memory), define cache keys, implement read-through/write-through patterns, and determine cache scope (e.g., per-user, global).

## 6. Implement Cache Invalidation Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.5
### Description: Develop strategies and mechanisms to ensure cached data remains fresh and consistent with the external API and internal system state.
### Details:
Implement time-to-live (TTL) policies, event-driven invalidation (e.g., webhooks from external API, internal data changes), and manual invalidation endpoints for administrative control.
