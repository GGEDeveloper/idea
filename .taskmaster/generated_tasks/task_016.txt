# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Product Action Buttons
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 24, 49
# Priority: high
# Description: Add 'Add to Cart', 'Add to Wishlist', and 'Compare Product' buttons to the Product Detail Page. **The 'Add to Cart' button should only be visible and functional for authenticated users, initiating the order placement process.**
# Details:
Buttons should trigger relevant actions, with 'Add to Cart' initiating order persistence in PostgreSQL. **Ensure 'Add to Cart' is tied to the authenticated user's session and the new order placement flow.**

# Test Strategy:
Verify buttons are clickable and initiate correct actions. **Test 'Add to Cart' visibility and functionality for authenticated vs. unauthenticated users.**
