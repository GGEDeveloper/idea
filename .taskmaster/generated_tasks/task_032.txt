# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Product Management (Admin)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive module in the Admin Area for managing products, categories, variations, and product images (CRUD operations).
# Details:
User-friendly interface for product data entry, with all product information managed in PostgreSQL.

# Test Strategy:
Verify products, categories, and variations can be created, read, updated, and deleted.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Core Product CRUD & Schema Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema for products in PostgreSQL (Neo). Develop backend API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting product records. Include basic validation, error handling, comprehensive logging, and define initial permission structures for product management. Ensure compliance requirements are considered for data storage.
### Details:
PostgreSQL (Neo) schema, RESTful API endpoints, basic data validation, logging, permissions, compliance.

## 2. Category Management Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the database schema and API endpoints for managing product categories, including support for hierarchical structures if required. Implement CRUD operations for categories, integrate with the product module, and ensure proper logging and access controls. Design the corresponding UI components for category administration.
### Details:
PostgreSQL (Neo) schema for categories, API for CRUD, UI components, logging, permissions.

## 3. Product Variation Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Extend the product schema and API to support product variations (e.g., size, color, material). Implement CRUD operations for variations, ensuring they are correctly linked to parent products. Develop backend logic for managing variation-specific attributes like price adjustments or stock. Include logging and permission checks.
### Details:
PostgreSQL (Neo) schema for variations, API for CRUD, linking to products, logging, permissions.

## 4. Image Management & Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1, 32.3
### Description: Implement functionality for uploading, storing, and retrieving product and variation images. Integrate with a cloud storage solution suitable for Vercel deployment (e.g., Vercel Blob or external CDN). Develop API endpoints for image operations and ensure images are correctly associated with products/variations. Address image compliance and optimize for performance.
### Details:
Cloud storage integration (Vercel-compatible), API for image upload/retrieval, image association, compliance, performance optimization.

## 5. Bulk Operations & External API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1, 32.2, 32.3, 32.4
### Description: Develop features for bulk import/export of products, categories, and variations, including data validation and error reporting. Implement integration with the external API Geko for product data synchronization or retrieval. Ensure robust logging for all bulk operations and external API interactions.
### Details:
Bulk import/export functionality, Geko API integration, data validation, error handling, comprehensive logging.

## 6. User Interface & Authentication Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1, 32.2, 32.3, 32.4, 32.5
### Description: Design and develop the Next.js/React frontend for all product management functionalities (CRUD, categories, variations, images, bulk ops). Implement user authentication using Auth.js/Clerk, including role-based access control for product managers. Integrate internationalization, implement automated UI tests, and design the onboarding flow for new product management users. Ensure cloud-native deployment readiness on Vercel.
### Details:
Next.js/React frontend, Auth.js/Clerk authentication, internationalization, automated UI tests, onboarding, Vercel deployment.
